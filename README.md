# Linked Lists Data Structure

These are any  collection of unordered data. They are not contagious in memory. They utilize nodes that reference the next node's memory location.
Linked Lists use Head and Tail to determine the end and beginning of the list. Insertion and mutability are supported with less space and time complexity as compared to Arrays. This is because the data does not occur in contagious form in memory unlike arrays.
